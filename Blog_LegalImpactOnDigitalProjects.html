                <img src="images/Blog_Splash.jpg" width=20%>
                <div>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In the digital age, the internet has allowed us to do various tasks in which we send out our
                        personal
                        information without really considering the consequences. When we use social media such as
                        Facebook
                        and Twitter, we upload personal information, such as contact information and images, and we do
                        freely.</p>

                    <p>But then in May 2018, GDPR was introduced, a measure of European privacy that changes the way
                        businesses collect, store, and use information of customers. It is an assurance that customer
                        information is secure and protected.</p>

                    <p>What that means for a business is now it is important to remember the rights of the citizens,
                        namely:
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Right to Access</h2>
                    <p>People have the rights to request any personal information that is held by a business as well as
                        information on how this information is being used. The business must provide this information
                        free
                        of charge. Digital projects that involve personal data must have this data easily accessible.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Right to Erasure</h2>
                    <p>People have the rights to have their information removed from a business when they stop being a
                        customer of that business, or they do not give their consent anymore, and businesses must comply
                        with this. For a digital project, a system needs to be in place where deletion of personal data
                        is
                        accomplishable.</p>

                    <h2>The Right of Transfer</h2>
                    <p>People have the rights to transfer their information from one business to another in a portable
                        format. Businesses must use a common form of data storage that other businesses can read. By
                        using
                        commonly used formats, digital projects can comply with this and have the personal data portable
                        if
                        need be.</p>

                    <h2>The Right to be Informed</h2>
                    <p>People have the rights to be informed when their personal information is being gathered by a
                        business, and also the fact that people must opt in for their information to be gathered
                        explicitly,
                        which wasn’t the case before GDPR. A digital project should have some sort of notice which
                        includes
                        a method where a user can give explicit consent to storage of personal data and explicitly opt
                        in
                        for services.</p>

                    <h2>The Right to Rectification</h2>
                    <p>People have the rights to update their data when it is incomplete or incorrect, and businesses
                        have
                        an obligation to update this information. Digital projects need methods where personal data can
                        be
                        easily modified to rectify incorrect information.</p>

                    <h2>The Right to Object</h2>
                    <p>When people desire, they have the right to prevent any processing of their data for marketing
                        directed towards them, and businesses must immediately stop upon receiving the request. A system
                        needs to be in place for a digital project to stop using personal data in marketing such as
                        removing
                        a person from a mailing list.</p>

                    <h2>The Right to be Notified</h2>
                    <p>In situations where a person’s information has been compromised, such as from a data breach, the
                        business has the obligation to notify the person within 72 hours. Since the digital project may
                        include contact information of the person, an email/letter could be sent to the person or a call
                        may
                        be made.</p>

                    <h2>The Right to Restrict Processing</h2>
                    <p>Similar to the right to object, in this situation, the person can request for their information
                        not
                        to be used in any processing by the business, i.e. the business may store the information, but
                        not
                        actually use it. Digital projects need to have a system in place where it is possible to store
                        the
                        person’s information while not being used at all.</p>

                    <h2>Overall</h2>
                    <p>Considering the rights that the GDPR gives to the individual, it is important for a business to meet
                    the
                    criteria to accept GDPR. Since in the realm of the digital age, customer information is stored using
                    computer systems, and is possibly actively used by computer systems such as an automated mailing
                    list
                    system, it is important for a business to follow the rules of the GDPR otherwise heavy penalties
                    could
                    follow; up to 4% of business annual revenue or 20 million Euros.</p>
