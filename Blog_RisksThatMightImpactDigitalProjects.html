                    <p>To use digital technology without care and consideration to the risks involved is asking for
                        failure.
                        As with most things, care needs to be taken with technology in order to help it best serve us in
                        the
                        most productive way.</p>

                    <h2>Unauthorized Access</h2>
                    <p>It is highly likely with the focus on collaboration during digital projects, a lot of the files
                        will
                        be available on the cloud/on the internet. Unfortunately, due to hacking, it may be possible for
                        others to access highly sensitive information that you may wish to keep private. It is even
                        possible
                        for someone who doesn’t know what they are doing to upload sensitive data and make it public
                        because
                        of a setting that they aren’t aware of or uploaded without reading the documentation to keep
                        data
                        secure. </p>

                    <h2>Hardware Failure</h2>
                    <p>While digital storage is convenient because it allows for storing files on disks that are
                        extremely
                        portable, what happens when those disks fail? What happens when a computer with the only backup
                        of
                        data suddenly experiences hardware failure. All that information is lost. It is a heart-breaking
                        moment especially when personal information is lost, but the impact on a business when important
                        data is lost can be extremely costly and can even cause businesses to fail. The importance of
                        backup
                        solutions cannot be overstated. Think about an automated database system that keeps track of
                        customer information, and then that information is lost. For a business, it would be like losing
                        all
                        of their customers overnight.</p>

                    <h2>Monetary Concerns</h2>
                    <p>Technology can be expensive, not only to set up the hardware itself, but also to employ
                        knowledgeable
                        members whose job it is to ensure that the technology is running smoothly. Because of the large
                        number of resources and how easy it is to get them, it is quite easy for a business to overspend
                        on
                        outside resources and eventually run out of money. It is a fact that most businesses fail due to
                        cash flow issues, and with the heavy emphasis on technology, it is quite possible that
                        businesses
                        are spending money on technology that they don’t need.</p>

                    <h2>Lack of Knowledge</h2>
                    <p>There’s no denying that technology is being updated all the time. New technologies are coming
                        out,
                        new features, new ideas, new applications...these all require one to learn them in order to use
                        them
                        in the right way. Unfortunately, as technology changes, it’s likely that without proper
                        education
                        and re-training, a business may lose its grasp on current technology and become obsolete.</p>
