                <h1>Selecting the Right IT System and Software</h1>

                    <hr>
                    <p>With the wide variety of technology out there, how do you select the right kind of technology for the
                        job?</p>
    
                    <p>Well there are many factors to consider, with the most important being:</p>
                    <h2>Needs</h2>
                    <p>Does the system/software do the job that you require? Say you are completing a 3D game project for
                        example, and you hear about ‘Construct’ as an extremely easy to use game engine...makes sense right?
                        Except that Construct is a 2D based game engine. While this may seem like an extreme example, it is
                        a typical situation of analyzing your needs and matching them to the software that can meet those
                        needs. There may even be situations where you have a software that matches most of your needs but
                        cannot meet them all. Do you sacrifice those other needs and try to make the best of what you have?
                        Do you try and customize the software in order to meet those needs. Will you have to create your own
                        software from scratch? Maybe so, but other factors need to be considered.</p>
                    <h2>Cost</h2>
                    <p>Software and systems can fit a wide variety of budgets, even being free at times. There might be a
                        specific piece of software that is perfect for your needs, but it may be extremely expensive, and if
                        there are multiple people working on a project, then multiple licenses or a site-wide license may
                        need to be purchased, and this can be very expensive. There may be free software that is well-suited
                        to your needs, but then sometimes they can involve licenses where they can be free at the start, but
                        should you earn above a certain threshold, you may be required to start paying for a license, such
                        as is the case with the Unity game engine. The initial set up will also require money to pay for the
                        hardware itself to run the software. You may even have to buy proprietary hardware to work with
                        specific software.</p>
    
                    <p>When the software is purchased or the system is in place, consideration should be given to the cost
                        of actually maintaining what you already have, where that be subscription-based software packages or
                        re-training because the technology has changed that much. </p>
    
                    <h2>Learning Curve</h2>
                    <p>Those working on a digital project will have to learn the software in order to be able to use it, and
                        the more they learn, the better use they get out of it. However, this all costs time and money, and
                        whether the business can spare the expense is a key concern. It’s possible that the team will be
                        able to get used to the software and get up and running with it in just a short time, minimizing
                        expense, but on the other hand, you may need to set up training programmes, have in-house training,
                        send staff to training camps/course providers. When choosing a software or system for a specific
                        need, the question “How familiar is my staff with the software?” should be considered.</p>
    
                    <h2>Support</h2>
                    <p>Consideration needs to be given to support given once the system/software has been purchased. If
                        there is a problem with the software and nobody knows how to fix it, it could very well be a
                        worst-case scenario for a business and they may even abandon the project altogether or overspend on
                        alternative technologies. The support given is dependent on the software itself. There may be phone
                        support. This could be immediate or you may be put on hold. Email support may be an option though
                        there is a delay in getting back to you. You may be able to bring someone in from the software’s
                        source to come in and sort the problem out. If the software is widely used, then there may be online
                        support in the form of forums, discussions, reddits, and comments. </p>
    
                    <h2>Defunct Software/Business</h2>
                    <p>How long has the provider of the software been in business? How well are they doing? What is the
                        business forecast like, i.e. do they seem successful for the future? These are concerns when you buy
                        software systems from them. What happens if they go out of business? It is highly unlikely that they
                        will still provide support for their software. There may be situations where the software you
                        bought/licensed from them is no longer under active development, meaning that software improvements
                        stop and support may be dropped. You may even have to think about upgrading to their next piece of
                        software, which brings with it all kinds of costs in terms of installation, training, and support.
                    </p>
    
                    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>A key concern is whether the new system is compatible with your current system, especially if you are
                        considering migrating current data over to a new system. Time and money is needed to migrate
                        information, and staff will need to be trained on the new software, but this section is regarding
                        whether the old information is compatible with the new information. Suppose you are migrating a
                        database to a new system or a new language. How easy will that be? Is there a risk of losing the
                        data that you already have?</p>
    
                    <h2>Willingness to Change</h2>
                    <p>Some people are dead set in their ways, but if it works for them then they put up a resistance if you
                        ask them to move to a new system or software. It makes high-level employees start at the bottom
                        because their knowledge of a new system is starting again from scratch. People are hesitant to
                        change, and unless the value of a new system or software can be clearly demonstrated, it may be
                        difficult in migrating to a new piece of software. </h2>
