                    <p>The importance of I.T. on modern business cannot be overstated. Whether a business is run by an
                        individual or is a multinational corporation, the benefits that technology brings allows
                        businesses to open communication with customers, better efficiency, improve teamwork and use
                        resources with ease.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p>Customers demand ease-of-use and access to information. As a website that is run 24-7, customers
                        are able to use the website to access the information they need to answer questions that they
                        have, thus allowing the customer to feel more comfortable with the business and feeling safe in
                        the knowledge that their questions are being answered. Due to e-commerce technologies, customers
                        are able to pay for and get the items they need from the comfort of their location anywhere in
                        the world. Technology helps a business be more approachable for customers.</p>
                    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
                    <p>A well-designed website allows a customer to browse through a business’s products and services at
                        their own leisure, saving on staff costs in the long run. Also, due an online presence, money
                        can be saved from purchasing physical space and put more towards getting the product into the
                        customer’s hands. As mentioned above, the convenience of e-commerce in getting things to order
                        from the comfort of the home is highly valued and is more comfortable for the customer. Even
                        running meetings in the business or outside of business is made far easier by having them over
                        the internet. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                    <p>A business is only made stronger by having members of a team work together, and the better they
                        work together, the better they perform. Technology allows members of a team to stay connected
                        with each other, and the use of an online shared space is priceless in order to relay and access
                        information. For example, the online platform ‘Trello’ can be used as an interactive whiteboard,
                        allowing team members to post topics and to-do lists up on a shareable board, as well as marking
                        off tasks that are completed in real-time. Google has a shareable space called ‘Google Drive’
                        where companies can sue the shared space to share files and information between each other
                        near-instantaneously, and even work on documents at the same time in collaboration with other
                        team members.</p>
                    <h2>Resources</h2>
                    <p>The fact that the resources of the world are available with a few clicks away allows a business
                        to complete its research in a much shorter time that if that technology was not available. The
                        internet itself is a network of computers all over the world, and there are so many resources
                        that are available to answer questions and solve problems. The fact of the matter is a lot of
                        problems that we have have most likely been solved, and it takes a few minutes on the internet
                        to research and find the solution, and even if the problem isn’t easily solvable, once the
                        solution has been found through independent means, the solution can be shared. This allows
                        businesses from all over the world to help each other.</p>
