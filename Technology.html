            <p>Here I will talk about my interest in technology and why it is a passion of mine to try and integrate it
                into every aspect of my life...where possible of course!.</p>

            <h2>Making Life Easier</h2>
            <p>I use technology to make life easier. For example, I can use a pencil and paper to draw some characters
                for a game that I am making. Digital art technology can help in this regard by allowing me to create
                layers for a character such as the character's body, which can be further split up into clothing,
                shading, lighting, etc, which isn't really possible with pencil and paper at that level of ease.</p>

            <h2>Shareability</h2>
            <p>One of the greatest aspects of technology is how easy it is to not only share what you have created
                extremely easily, but also get feedback on that work. This is highly valuable for someone who wishes to
                improve their skills, and it creates a sense of responsibility because when you upload something, you
                are opening up the option for the world to critique your work. The feedback may be negative, positive,
                or even toxic (there are some bad people out there), but the sense that you are improving all the time
                is something that drives one to be better.</p>

            <h2>Backups</h2>
            <p>There are few things as heartbreaking as losing something that means a great deal to you. With the
                transfer to technology, these items can be sent to the cloud, which is an online digital space where
                files can be sent. Not only can they be sent, but shared with others, and even worked on together in
                real-time (though this applies to certain files on certain services).</p>
