                    <p>This is an example of a technology. I am wanting to set up as a consultant, and to prove my
                        knowledge, I am creating this blog about myself, as well as different sections describing why I
                        am
                        interested in technology. I have created this website using technologies what have led me to
                        success, which I will discuss below.</p>
                    <h2>Trello</h2>
                    <p>Creating a blog covering myself and various other sections is no small feat. It is a huge
                        undertaking
                        and to dive right in can be overwhelming. Trello is an online interactive whiteboard where you
                        can
                        put post-it notes in the form of cards on the board. This can be private or shared between
                        specific
                        individuals or made completely public.</p>

                    <p>My trello board for this blog, located at:</p>
                    <p><a href="https://trello.com/b/3uChCdBR/code-nation-consultant-blog">Trello: Code Nation
                            Blog</a></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>allowed me to take the problem that I have and divide it into smaller and more manageable tasks
                        that
                        as a whole, allowing me to create my website while ensuring that I have covered all the bases that
                        I
                        need to cover. Due to the public nature of the board, I was able to share the board with others
                        and
                        ask for feedback. Once the board has been created, I can then simply follow what I have done and
                        tick-off tasks that I have done. If I came across a task that seemed too general and
                        overwhelming, I
                        would then edit the board and divide the task up further into more manageable tasks, eventually
                        leading to the successful creation of a website that you are now browsing. </p>

                    <h2>GitHub</h2>
                    <p>Creating a website involves not only the planning and preparation of it but also the building of
                        it,
                        which in my case, involved using HTML for basic content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
                        additional functionality. These three systems work together to make my website usable. I use
                        Visual
                        Studio Code to create these various files, but what if I need to see the version history of my
                        files. If I share my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with others and they make changes, how do I
                        see
                        the changes that they have made? Am I able to approve their changes? Can I even rollback to an
                        earlier version of the file in case the worst happens? This is where GitHub comes in.</p>

                    <p>GitHub allows me to effectively sync my files to an online repository where I am able to look at
                        the
                        files in the repository and see any history of changes. I am able to even fork a project, make
                        changes, then submit pull requests in order for my changes to apply to the main project itself.
                        The
                        online nature of the GitHub repository allows me to share what I have done with others for not
                        only
                        educational purposes but also for others to comment and give feedback on what I have done.</p>

                    <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
                    <p>I needed an integrated development environment where I was able to collate my files from a
                        specific
                        folder and make changes. I also needed the various files to be readable, with HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript each having their own syntax and indenting styles. More than just a text editor,
                        Visual
                        Studio Code has an intellisense feature that allows me to have my code automatically fill in as
                        I
                        type. For example, if I’m writing in HTML and I use the

                        <head> tag, then Visual Studio Code’s intellisense feature will automatically fill in the
                        </head>
                        tag that I need at the end of that section. If I’m writing in JavaScript and I make a simple
                        syntax
                        error, then Visual Studio Code’s debugging and console features allow me to quickly identify the
                        problem and help me get my website’s functionality up and running faster.</p>

                    <h2>PlayCode.io, CodePen</h2>
                    <p>When designing visual aspects of my website, I can edit the files in Visual Studio Code, save the
                        files, then open the files in an internet browser and see what my website looks like. But there
                        are
                        times where I need to see how the website looks on the fly, i.e. the website updates with every
                        single edit made to the file. This is where a website such as playcode.io or codepen.io really
                        comes
                        in handy.</p>

                    <p>If I need to test something quickly, I’ll take the code from Visual Studio Code and send it to
                        PlayCode.io, and then I can see in real-time how the website looks.</p>

                    <p>By quickly testing something or even just using trial and error in a playful manner to experiment
                        with the code and try new ideas is saves a lot of time and because I can see the results in
                        real-time, I can make decisions faster such as where I want my navigation bar, what color should
                        my
                        background be, and quickly test styles. Once I’m happy with the results, I’ll take the code back
                        into Visual Studio Code and save it and use it as part of the main website.</p>
