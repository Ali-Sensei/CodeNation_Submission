      <p>Hello and welcome to my website. As a technical consultant, I am looking
        forward to showing you my thoughts on technology and showing you how I plan,
        select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs. <br><br>
        Please use the navigation bar above to browse around, and please enjoy your stay!</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ali and I have a varied background. <br><br>
        I have worked in the games industry at Gizmondo Studios, Electronic Arts, and DICE.<br><br>
        I've taught English to children in South Korea for ten years.<br><br>
        Now I've returned to England and re-learning the skills I need to make computer games.<br><br>
        Please check out the 'Showcase' section of the website to see what I have done in the past.
      </p>

      <h2>My Interest in Coding</h2>
      <p>The skill to take what's in your head and put it into reality is amazing. My imagination is bursting at the
        seams. I day dream a lot. I imagine stories in my head. I replay stories in my head. I would love to be able to
        make games based on what is in my head. Learning to code will give me the tools I need to do so.</p>
