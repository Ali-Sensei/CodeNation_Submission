                <p>This is a review of the website that I have created. I have definitely learned a lot for next time.

                <h2>Appropriateness, Benefits and Drawbacks of IT Tools Used In Terms of Productivity and Efficiency
                </h2>
                <p>From such a large range of digital tools to choose from, it can be overwhelming to decide on a
                    particular few. The tools I chose were based off of what was available to me at the time, what I was
                    being taught in, and my familiarity with it. Here I talk about the tools that I used, how
                    appropriate the tools were for my purposes, and how I felt using them in regards to their benefits
                    and drawbacks.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <b>Visual Studio Code:</b>
                <p>Visual Studio Code was really the only choice of IDE for me. I had used Visual Studio before, but
                    Visual Studio Code is quite similar. It has a smart Intellisense, an excellent workspace system, and
                    most importantly, the ability to create files in HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
                <p>Visual Studio Code's usage of workspaces was incredibly efficient. By opening a workspace that
                    had
                    the contents of the folder that contained my site, not only including all HTML, CSS, and JS files
                    but
                    also the images used, I could see at a glance the organization of my site, and freely click on
                    and
                    edit files in Visual Studio Code quite easily. The fact that Visual Studio Code provided
                    'Intellisense' allowed me to quickly look at code and identify errors, usually simple typo
                    errors,
                    but may have been difficult to find in a regular text editor.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately there were times
                    where I needed to make changes after a page had been created such as fixing bugs, and sometimes
                    Intellisense would not work correctly. For example, Intellisense would insert code when I didn't
                    need it, which was incredibly aggravating and I had to work around the Intellisense system
                    sometimes to get what I needed.</p>
                <b>CodePen/PlayCode</b>
                <p>These two websites allowed me to live-preview changes that were made to the site. By seeing the
                    changes in real-time, I could ensure that the site looked the way I wanted *as I was writing
                    it*, plus I was able to interactively preview styles by editing the CSS files which enabled me
                    to come to a consensus on what look my site should take.</p>
                <p>This was a huge advantage in terms of seeing the changes to the site made in real-time, which really
                    helped me figure out the styling that I was going to use as well as basic decisions such as the
                    colors that I would use. The fact that I could change some CSS lines and then immediately see the
                    results was really useful!</p>
                <p>However, while it was efficient to use,
                    because these are browser programs and I use the trackpad quite a lot to switch between windows,
                    sometimes when switching to another window, I would accidentally 'go back' out of the browser
                    window, and then when I returned to CodePen or PlayCode, all the changes would be gone.
                    Sometimes, I lost a large amount of changes. This got to a point where if I was making major
                    changes, I would not use them, only using them for small things such as styling options and
                    margin layouts.</p>
                <b>Trello</b>
                <p>Trello is an interactive whiteboard that I used to keep track of tasks and to check the tasks
                    off as I completed them. I could add cards based on project tasks and then add checklists to those
                    cards to be very specific about what the task is asking for, allowing me to divide up tasks further
                    if I needed to.</p>
                <p>Trello was really useful because I could see the overall project at a glance and I was able to
                    easily add cards to the board as well as add and edit checklists. If I needed to further divide up
                    the tasks, I could do so by editing the checklist. A lot of the cards had checklists common to them,
                    and Trello had a feature where I could integrate the same checklist into cards and then simply edit
                    one checklist to make changes in all of them, saving a lot of time.</p>
                <p>I didn't
                    like the fact that the checklists were embedded in a card, and I would have to open the card to
                    look at the checklist. What I really wanted was an open glance at the tasks that I had yet to
                    do. I think learning more about Trello would allow me to increase my efficiency of using it.</p>
                <b>Google Chrome's Inspect Feature</b>
                <p>I had learned about using Google Chrome's Inspect feature when I was trouble-shooting issues, and for
                    this purpose, it was highly appropriate to debugging.</p>
                <p>The inspect feature allowed me to quickly highlight a section that
                    was having issues, look at the inspector, and find how it was working. This allowed me to
                    quickly pin point problems and fix them in Visual Studio Code. The 'Inspect' feature was also
                    very useful to look at other sites that I had used for inspiration during the planning phase to
                    see how they worked.</p>
                <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                <p>Had I done a mockup beforehand, this project would have been much easier to do in teams. Since
                    everyone has a visual idea and a reference to what the site should look like and what it should
                    be
                    capable of, our team members could work off that and the specific tasks from a Trello board to
                    create the content for the site, and to style the site itself.</p>
                <p>If working in teams during the building phase, some team members would be used to create the CSS
                    files in order to style the website, another to create the navigation bar, and others to put in
                    content for the site. By giving each team member a designated role, it should make the work easier
                    to manage and prevent overlap between departments.</p>
                </p>
                <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Site</h2>
                <p>To critique my site will allow me to consider what areas I should improve on but also what areas I believe I did well in and may wish to consider re-using/adapting in future projects.</p>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>Overall, I have made a good first site in my opinion. The site does what it needs to. Each page of the site is its own section, with page headings that are easy to understand.</p> 
                <p>Each section is easily accessible through a navigation bar that is fixed regardless of the vertical scroll position, increasing ease of use. The navigation bar also includes the feature to highlight where the user is on the site by using an 'active' class. The text and images are easily readable. The blog section is expandable because of its side menu bar and column style of display. I could theoretically extend the menu to include as many blog articles as I wanted. By using a CSS style sheet that is included on each page, I am easily able to edit the style in order to affect the entirety of the site with ease.</p>
                <p>By using percents instead of pixels where I could, the site is responsive and adaptable to multiple window sizes. I have included margins based off of percents, so the website remains nicely framed.</p>
                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>Regarding weaknesses, there are many ways in which the website could be improved. The navigation bar, while incredibly useful, is badly implemented in my opinion. The fact that I have to update the navigation bar on every single page of the site when I need to make a change is extremely tedious, and would have been far better if I had the HTML for the navigation bar in a central location, and then simply include the navigation bar in the HTML on the site's pages.</p>
                <p>I also think improving the presentation of the site would help. I could have included a splash home page that immediately sets the tone and leaves a great impact. Instead, what I currently have is that my site arrives at index.html where there is a wall of text talking about myself. The first impression could have been greatly improved.</p>
                <p>I didn't think about trends and standards of sites in 2019. I created much of the styling of the website using default settings, and I essentially 'played around' with settings in CSS to find a style that looked good to me. I had later found that there were advised practices that suggest font sizes, title sizes, color matching, which if I had done the research, but site would look more presentable than it currently is and bring it up to the modern standard in 2019.</p>
                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>Planning the website in advance would have been a huge time-saver in regards to deciding the style of the site, as well as deciding the structure of the site such as using appropriate div classes. Then it would have been much easier implement, simply adding the content through HTML and then following my mockups to code the style in CSS.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, by looking at current trends and standards, I could bring my site up to the modern age and make it more presentable for users.</p>
                <p>I would also try and figure out the sections I needed in advance, because once I implemented the navigation bar on every page, making a change such as adding a new link to the navigation bar resulted in me editing it on every page that I had. As the website increased in complexity and required more and more pages, making these kinds of small changes over and over again was extremely tedious, and most definitely used up a lot of time.</p>
                <p>Testing of the site was strictly made in a full screen browser window on a computer. Once the site was done and I started resizing, elements of the site would move in a way where they would overlap or disappear from site, i.e. not how the site is intended to look. For the future, I would implement testing on mobile devices/devices with smaller screens much earlier, especially since in this day and age, a large percentage of the internet population access it on a mobile device.</p>
                <h2>Does the Outcome Match the Requirements</h2>
                <p>This site was made using guidelines provided to me in the form of a bulleted list, which I then added to Trello in checklist form to make sure that I had gone over and completed all the tasks required in order for my site to fulfil the requirements. Once completed, I looked over the site and made sure that the requirements were actually fulfilled; they had been done but I was going over to make sure./p>
                <h2>Ways to Improve Productivity and Efficiency</h2>
                <p>All things considered, I could have been more efficient when making the website, more specifically
                    during the planning stage.</p>
                <p>I found myself going back over what I have done and changing things, trying different styles out,
                    and so much more. While CodePen and PlayCode were very useful in trying out different styles by
                    'playing around' in CSS, it would have been better for me to create a mockup in a program such as
                    PowerPoint where I could easily figure out how my website should look, the div blocks that it should
                    use. Had I created a mockup, I could have then organized my div boxes appropriately and the process
                    of building the pages would have been a lot more smoother.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, creating mockups to figure out how they site would look would have made the
                    decisions to style the site much easier, since I would have already figured out the styling
                    during
                    the mockup phase. Also, by thinking about what pages would look like, I would also have a list
                    of
                    pages that would be included in the site. Eventually, the folder containing the files because
                    very
                    disorganized to the point where I created folders to hold the scripts. In future, I would have
                    also
                    created separate folders for the various assets that the site would use in order to improve
                    organization, which would improve efficiency.</p>
                <p>I also wasn't concerned with portability of code, but I should have. For example, my site
                    used a
                    navigation bar that used CSS to display a clean navigation bar towards the top of the
                    screen. I
                    also created a side menu bar with content using a columns system for the 'Blog' section of
                    the
                    site. These two menus are all contained within the same css file. If I want to use these
                    menus
                    again, I would have to go through the process if importing the styles.css file and taking
                    what I
                    needed. Instead, it would have been more efficient to put these into seperate CSS files so
                    that
                    they are more portable and easily transferable to other projects.</p>

                <p>A major issue that really slowed down progress was the fact that I had copied and pasted the
                    navigation menu code in every HTML page used on the site. Then, if I needed to make changes
                    to
                    the navigation menu, I would have to edit the menu on every page all over again. This really
                    affected the time took to make a simple change, and for the future, I would have the menu
                    imported in a way where I could simply include a file containing the menu on all the pages,
                    then
                    if I needed to make changes to the menu, I would change the base file. This would have
                    improved
                    efficiency by a great deal.</p>
                </p>
                <h2>Solutions to Improve Own Digital Productivity Using IT in Digital Projects</h2>
                <p>Next time, I would create mockups. I would decide the style and look of the website before I
                    created
                    it. I would use appropriate div containers such as 'FlexBox' that would allow for a more
                    responsive
                    website with much more ease. I would not start the project itself until the mockups and prep
                    work
                    was thoroughly done. If changes occured during the project itself, I would pay more
                    consideration to
                    how they would affect the time invested vs the return made from the change.</p>
                <p>Teamwork would have improved the productivity in cases where team members had experience with a
                    particular part of site-building, and they could share their expertise with the team in order to
                    solve problems or create something that was difficult for others to understand. Some team
                    members
                    are more creatively-minded than others that could help with the styling of the site. Other team
                    members are more analytical, who could then provide feedback on systems/organizational
                    techniques
                    used in the creation of the site, such as using appropriate blocks such as
                    'block/inline-block/flexbox'.</p>
                <h2>Testing Digital Solutions</h2>
                <p>There are often times that creators such as myself cannot see the mistakes that they have made,
                    but
                    they seem so obvious to fresh eyes. While Visual Studio Code's 'Intellisense' feature helped
                    with
                    this by highlighting incorrect typos with colored lines, fresh eyes would definitely help with
                    testing digital solutions. For a web site, a tester could even offer their own opinion as to the
                    layout of the site, its navigation system, and its styling. For example, there was a point where
                    I
                    had created my navigation bar to be horizontal instead of vertical, and when I showed it to a
                    colleague, an opinion was given where most sites are gravitating towards using vertical menus as
                    their main source of navigation, and horizontal navigation menus were a thing of the past. I
                    took
                    this advice to heart, and changed my navigation system so that it was vertical, like how you see
                    it
                    now along the top of the page.</p>
                <h2>Content and Layout for Each Page</h2>
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>Once I had decided on a vertical navigation menu, I thought about the different sections that the
                    navigation bar would have. To this end, I looked at Trello where at a glance I could see the
                    different sections that my website would have, then thought about the grouping of these sections
                    into five main sections: Home, Technology, Blog, Showcase, and Review.</p>
                <h3>Home</h3>
                <p>This page has my name, my desired role of 'Technical Consultant' and a professional picture of
                    myself
                    as a basic introduction. There is a short 'About Me' section where I describe my history, and
                    there
                    is also a 'My Interest in Coding' section where I describe my passion for coding, which should
                    allow
                    someone viewing the site to see what I am all about.</p>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>This page is dedicated to discussing my interest in technology as a whole and why I swear by it
                    in
                    everyday use. It covers sections such as the all-important 'Making Life Easier', as well as
                    great
                    advantages of technology such as 'Shareability' and 'Backups'</p>
                <h3>Blog</h3>
                <p>This is a section that covers a wide variety of topics relating to technology. I wanted this
                    section
                    be expandable infinitely, so to put all of the blog content on one page would have been a
                    mistake in
                    my opinion. Instead, I put different articles of the blog onto their own page. Because of the
                    large
                    number of articles that I may have in the future, I made a special page style that was split
                    into
                    two columns, with one column holding the sidebar to navigate the articles, and another column to
                    hold the article itself. This is exlusive to this page but it was important for me to do this
                    since
                    it was one of the sections of the site that would be updated over time, whereas most of the
                    other
                    sections are static and their content doesn't change much.</p>
                <h3>Showcase</h3>
                <p>This is a section so that I could demonstrate what I know, and for this, I used a parallax
                    scrolling
                    effect that would allow me to present my work. I used the parallax feature because it leaves a
                    lasting visual impression and is very interesting to look at. I want my work to have this kind
                    of
                    impression so that my work is highly thought of and a site user would be eager to scroll through
                    the
                    page and experience my work in full screen. The section also includes pages where people can
                    play
                    games that I have created, and for this, another 'container' page is used so that there would be
                    no
                    issues with scrolling. The user can play the game on these sections and then click the 'Go Back'
                    button to return to the Showcase section.</p>
                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>Improvements can only be made after receiving criticism, and the review section works towards
                    that
                    purpose. In the review section, I critique my work based off a long list of questions that I ask
                    myself. The section is quite long split up by heading2 as the main title for each section, plus
                    heading3 to allow sub-headings where content needed to be split up for easier readability and
                    ease
                    of use.</p>
                <h2>Copyright and Other Constraints Affecting Websites</h2>
                <p>The text itself was copied from text that I had put into Google Docs for the purpose of
                    spell-check
                    and grammar errors. Once the content phase was done, the styling phase commenced and here is
                    where I
                    thought about the specific images that would be used in the website. For the images, I used
                    unsplash.com as it provides high-quality images that are legally allowed to be used in the
                    site.There is a photo of me, but it's my photo so there shouldn't be a problem with copyright.
                </p>
                <p>I consider copyright to be something to be taken seriously as it is effectively stealing when
                    using
                    other people's work in a way that doesn't follow their wishes. Sometimes people freely allow
                    their
                    work to be used even commercially, but there are situations where this would not be acceptable.
                    For
                    example, while Google image provides a massive library of images, I hesitates to use them
                    because I
                    wasn't sure of their copyright usage, and if I had the slightest doubt, I would not use them.
                    The
                    site itself as it stands does not use copyrighted images as far as I'm aware. The projects in
                    the
                    Showcase section of the site were created by me using assets such as sprites created by others,
                    but
                    since the projects are not for commercial use and simply for your perusal, I believe that I am
                    within my legal rights.</p>
                <p>Other constraints include technology that may need to be used but either the creator doesn't know
                    how
                    to use them or isn't aware of them. For example, I experienced a lot of problems trying to
                    create a
                    way in which my navigation menu would appear on every page without me having to copy and paste
                    the
                    navigation menu in every page. But I did, and now if I need to make a change, I need to edit the
                    navigation menu in all pages of the site. I tried to do some research on how to have my
                    navigation
                    menu on every page from a single file, but these resulted in failures or required libraries that
                    I
                    wasn't familiar with. For example, I found solutions using Bootstrap and React, but I had no
                    knowledge of these and decided to save these solutions for another project.</p>
                <p>Screen size was also a major issue, as I had created the site completely on a notebook computer,
                    i.e.
                    the site was created on a large display. Then I resized the website and while the site did hold
                    up
                    under scrutiny due to my preference of percents over pixels, there were some elements of the
                    site
                    that effectively broke, came out of position, and just looked ugly. Working in CSS allowed me to
                    fix
                    most, but not all of the problems. Early testing on mobile devices would have allowed me to
                    build my
                    site with mobile in mind, allowing the site to work better on those smaller screens.</p>
                <p>Sites also have to consider the target platform that the pages are being displayed on, such as
                    using
                    Safari or Firefox instead of Chrome. Most of my testing was in Chrome, and when testing on other
                    sites, I became aware of specific requirements of other browsers where I needed to edit the CSS
                    code
                    slightly to allow my code to work. </p>
                <h2>Access Issues That Need Taking Into Account</h2>
                <p>Access to the website is dependent on the device and browser that is being used. For example,
                    elements look very different on a smaller screen, and may even become out of place, as described
                    above. Also, different browsers are capable of certain technologies that may be used on other
                    browsers but changes need to be made to the source code in order to have the site compatible.
                </p>
                <p>Access to the site is dependent on the person themselves, such as the disabled. In the case of
                    blind
                    people, they cannot view the text that the pages show so they may be using a text-to-speech
                    reader.
                    While I did try to improve the visual aspect of the site by including high-quality images, these
                    would be lost on the blind, except in cases where their text-to-speech reader is able to speak
                    the
                    'caption' part of the images. The Showcase section in particular would be quite useless since
                    the
                    projects I created have no consideration for blind.</p>
                <p>My site doesn't use that many sounds or music except in the Showcase section where users are able
                    to
                    play some games. Text has been set to an appropriate size, but could be made larger quite simply
                    using CSS. Background-colors and images are quite important in order to make the text readable;
                    I've
                    chosen a light background with headings 1,2 and 3 each having a unique style, with heading h1 in
                    particular having a yellow background to indicate clear sections in a longer page.</p>
